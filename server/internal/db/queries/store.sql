-- name: ClaimActiveFeishuInflightConversations :many
-- Multi-pod-safe sibling of ListActiveFeishuInflightConversations.
-- Without claim semantics, 4 server pods all SELECT the same row,
-- all enter the driver's first-send branch, and all call Feishu
-- SendMessage — the user ends up with N working cards instead of
-- one being patched in place. The optimistic-lock on the metadata
-- Upsert only guards the metadata write; it cannot un-send a
-- message Feishu already accepted.
--
-- Mirrors ClaimPendingFeishuOutbound's pattern:
--   1) WITH picked AS (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE OF c SKIP LOCKED LIMIT N)
--      — row-locks the conversation each pod sees; sibling pods
--      see disjoint batches.
--   2) UPDATE conversations ... FROM picked — stamps
--      gateway_inflight_claim subtree under metadata so subsequent
--      SELECTs (including from this pod's own next tick) see the
--      claim.
--
-- Stale claims (claim_at older than @stale_before) are recoverable:
-- a sibling pod sees them as candidate rows and overwrites the
-- subtree with its own claim_at. Same window the driver passes —
-- typically ~30s, much larger than the 1-2s tick cadence so a
-- healthy pod never loses its claim, much smaller than any
-- plausible "card stuck" tolerance.
--
-- The @claimed_by branch (`= @claimed_by`) lets a pod re-acquire
-- its OWN claim regardless of age — without this clause, a pod
-- whose tick happened to overlap @stale_before by a millisecond
-- would lose its conv to itself on the next SELECT, producing a
-- pointless metadata write (and a confusing audit trail).
--
-- Run-event filter: we include user-visible events (tool.call,
-- Run-event filter: we include user-visible events (tool.call,
-- message.delta, message.thinking, permission.asked) AND the
-- lifecycle events that the driver itself needs to react to:
--   - run.started: wake the driver the moment a run begins so it
--     sends a placeholder card and locks in the one-and-only
--     message_id for this conversation. Every subsequent tick
--     patches the same card.
--   - run.completed / run.failed: wake the driver when seq_emitted
--     has already caught up to max_seq but the terminal Done /
--     Error card patch still needs to fire. Without these in the
--     set, a run whose last user-visible event arrived before
--     completion would leave the driver stuck on "executing" and a
--     second card would get written by a downstream consumer
--     (historically the P1 outbound worker, which produced one
--     half of the "two cards per query" bug). The driver consults
--     c.RunStatus directly to decide which terminal card to render.
--
-- run.cancelled / run.requeued / run.superseded are NOT in this
-- set: those go through runtime's explicit status-flip +
-- ClearSlot path, not the card driver.
--
-- Terminal-card idempotency: once a run reaches completed/failed and
-- the driver has sent (or patched) the terminal card, it stamps
-- gateway_delivered_at onto the agent_runs.output_message_id row via
-- MarkGatewayOutboundDelivered. The LEFT JOIN below threads that
-- marker into the claim filter so a finished + delivered run stops
-- being re-picked on every tick — without it, the driver would
-- repeatedly hit the terminal branch and re-send the same Done card
-- (the 2026-06-12 sharedbot card-spam bug, the other half of the
-- "two cards per query" symptom). For runs still in-flight
-- (finished_at IS NULL) the marker check is skipped so mid-run
-- patches keep flowing.

-- name: ClaimPendingQueuedFeishuRuns :many
-- Multi-pod-safe replacement for the prior ListPendingQueuedFeishuRuns.
-- Without a claim, every sibling pod's tick SELECT-ed the same queued
-- runs, every pod called Feishu SendMessage, and the user saw N
-- duplicate "queued" cards (the prod regression on 2026-06-15:
-- 4 queued runs × 2 pods → up to 8 cards, only 1 ended up with the
-- queue_card_sent_at stamp because StampQueueCardSent's last-writer-
-- wins UPDATE hid the storm). The metadata stamp is too late to
-- prevent the duplicate sends.
--
-- This claim variant mirrors ClaimActiveFeishuInflightConversations:
--   1) WITH picked AS (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE OF r SKIP LOCKED LIMIT N)
--      — row-locks the agent_runs row each pod sees; sibling pods
--      see disjoint batches.
--   2) UPDATE agent_runs ... FROM picked — stamps
--      queue_card_claim subtree under metadata so subsequent SELECTs
--      (including from this pod's own next tick) see the claim.
--
-- Stale claims (claim_at older than @stale_before) are recoverable:
-- a sibling pod sees them as candidate rows and overwrites the
-- subtree with its own claim_at. Same window the inflight driver
-- passes — typically ~30s, much larger than the 1-2s tick cadence so
-- a healthy pod never loses its claim, much smaller than any
-- plausible "send stuck" tolerance.
--
-- The @claimed_by branch (`= @claimed_by`) lets a pod re-acquire its
-- OWN claim regardless of age — without it, a pod whose tick happened
-- to overlap @stale_before by a millisecond would lose its run to
-- itself on the next SELECT, producing a pointless metadata write.
--
-- Filters (unchanged from the listing variant beyond claim):
--   - r.status = 'queued' so we don't race the inflight driver after
--     the run flips to running (the inflight slot owns the working
--     card from that point on)
--   - coalesce(...->>'queue_card_sent_at','') = '' for the
--     post-send idempotency stamp; once StampQueueCardSent fires
--     subsequent ticks skip the row entirely
--   - r.created_at > @cutoff bounds the work: a queued run older than
--     a few minutes is almost certainly stuck behind a dead inflight
--     sibling; chasing it here wouldn't help the user understand
--     anything we couldn't surface from the regular failure path

-- time, immutable for the run's lifetime) rather than "most recent
-- user message <= run.started_at". The old criterion was bypassed when
-- the user typed a fresh message AFTER the credential-form submit but
-- BEFORE the daemon stamped run.started_at — the new typed message
-- satisfied <= started_at and ReenqueuedFrom was empty, so the
-- anti-rerun loop guard didn't fire and the form card was emitted
-- again for the same dead-end credential. Tying to trigger_message_id
-- — the invariant set in the same tx that created the run — closes
-- that gap without depending on wall-clock ordering of fresh inbounds
-- vs the daemon's run-status flip.
--
-- Also returns metadata.reenqueued_from so the form-card path can
-- detect "this turn already came back from a credential-form submit
-- and the same kind is STILL missing" — that means the user mistyped
-- and a second form card would just loop. In that case the caller
-- falls through to the regular terminal card (the user still has the
-- per-conversation in-chat system message telling them to bind via
-- the web UI).
--
-- sender_open_id is the inbound sender's raw Feishu open_id, captured

-- can verify the click is from the same person who triggered the inbound
-- (callback.Operator.OpenID is open_id; we can't fall back to union_id
-- because callback.Operator has no union field). Without this pinning
